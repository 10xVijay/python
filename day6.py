print(3*8) #in the multiplication if you multiply two different variable string or int it will give output 

print("data"*3)

print(5**2) # this is used for power qube etc.

print(8/3) #this is used for division it always return float values

print(16//5 ) 

print(16%3) #this is used for moduls means when you divide something and some Remainder remains so we use this modulas to find that Remainder
